## Matching Dates in YYYY-MM-DD Format

Introductory paragraph: Regular expressions (regex) are a powerful tool for matching patterns in text data. In this article, we will explore how to use regex to match dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format. We will discuss the different regex components such as anchors, quantifiers, character classes, grouping and capturing, and more.

## Summary

The regex we will be discussing is used to match dates in the format of YYYY-MM-DD. This format is commonly used in databases, file naming conventions, and other systems. The regex for this format is as follows:

```
/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/
```

This regex uses anchors to match the start and end of the string (^ and $ respectively), followed by three groups of digits separated by hyphens. The \d character class is used to match any digit, and the {4} and {2} quantifiers specify the number of digits to match.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

The ^ and $ anchors are used to match the start and end of the string, respectively. In our regex, we use these anchors to ensure that the entire string matches the YYYY-MM-DD format.

### Quantifiers

The {4} and {2} quantifiers are used to match exactly four and two occurrences of the preceding \d character class, respectively. These quantifiers are used to match the year, month, and day components of the date.

### Character Classes

The \d character class matches any digit. This character class is used to match the year, month, and day components of the date.

### Boundaries

The ^ and $ anchors serve as boundaries in this regex, ensuring that the entire string matches the YYYY-MM-DD format.
